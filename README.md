# Running Background Tasks with Celery

## Description

This project was created while following part 3 of
[codewithmosh.com's](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-django-series)
Ultimate Django Series.

In the final part of the series, we learn about advanced concepts in Django.

The purpose of this repository is to act as reference when implementing various
concepts in future projects.

Each branch in the project relates to different sections of the course that I
decided to save.
